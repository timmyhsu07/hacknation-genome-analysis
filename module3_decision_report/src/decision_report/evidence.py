"""Evidence categorization (Module 3).

Assigns each drug prediction EXACTLY ONE evidence category from Module 1
provenance (the long hits) plus Module 2 drivers (top features):

  (i)  KNOWN_MECHANISM  - a curated known resistance determinant for this drug's
       class was detected by an exact method (EXACT/POINT/ALLELE), or a
       known-mechanism model feature drives the resistant call.
  (ii) ASSOCIATION_ONLY - the call is driven by non-curated signal: resistance
       hits of the right class seen only by weak methods (BLAST/PARTIAL/HMM), or
       non-mechanism statistical features. Labeled association, NOT causation.
  (iii) NO_SIGNAL       - neither of the above; the prediction is driven by the
       ABSENCE of resistance markers.

The category is computed independently of the final label so it can be shown as
honest provenance even when the label is a no-call.
